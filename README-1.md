Explanation:

Functions: The functionalities like adding, editing, deleting, searching, and viewing contacts are implemented as separate functions (add_contact, edit_contact, etc.) for better code organization and modularity.

Dictionary (contacts): Contact information is stored in a dictionary, where each contact name is a key, and the corresponding value is another dictionary containing the phone number and email address.

main function: The main program loop is in the main function, where the user is presented with a menu to choose various operations.

if __name__ == "__main__":: This line ensures that the main function is only called when the script is run directly (not when it's imported as a module).

To run the code:

Copy the code into a Python file (e.g., contact_manager.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the Python file.
Run the script by entering: python contact_manager.py (or python3 contact_manager.py on some systems).
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the contact management system.
