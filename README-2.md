Explanation of the code:

The quiz_questions list contains dictionaries for each question with the question text, options, and the correct answer.

The run_quiz function shuffles the questions using random.shuffle() for variety. It then iterates through the questions, presents them to the user, and tracks the score.

The quiz accepts user input for answers and compares them with the correct answers.

The main block initiates the quiz, records the start and end times, and calculates the elapsed time.

To run the code:

Copy the provided code into a Python file (e.g., quiz_app.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing the Python file.
Run the script by entering: python quiz_app.py (Make sure you have Python installed on your system).
