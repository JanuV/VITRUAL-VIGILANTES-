**Explanation**
1.The count_words function takes a text as input and processes it to count word frequencies. It removes punctuation and converts the entire text to lowercase.
2.We split the text into words using .split().
3.The word_counts dictionary stores each unique word and its frequency.
4.The main function reads either user input or a file (if the input is a valid filename).
5.It calls count_words to calculate word frequencies.
6.Finally, it displays the word frequencies.
**How to Run**
1.Save the code above to a Python file (e.g., word_frequency.py).
2.Open a terminal or command prompt.
3.Navigate to the directory containing the Python file.
4.Run the program using python word_frequency.py.
5.Enter your text or provide a filename (e.g., sample.txt).
