**To run the code:**

1.Copy the code into a file, e.g., task_manager.py.
2.Open a terminal in the same directory as the script.
3.Run the script by executing python task_manager.py.
The program will prompt you to enter the date, and then you can choose to view tasks, add tasks, mark tasks as completed, or exit the program. 
The tasks are stored in a tasks.json file, so they persist between program executions.
